# Conway's Game of Life

This is a Rust implementation of Conway's
[Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)
done in class during Portland State University CS410/510
Rust Summer 2019.

The game is implemented in successive stages to show
features of the language. It is not intended to be
particularly spectacular: just a fun learning exercise.
